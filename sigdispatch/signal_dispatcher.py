class SignalDispatcher(object):
    """
    A **signal dispatcher** is a channel for sending signals through. It makes
    signals arrive to its observers (ie. dispatches them).

    A **signal** is an arbitrary message which can be emitted and received.

    A signal has a **code**, a string that identifies which kind of signal it
    is.

    A signal also may have a **payload**; it can be any value, provided it's
    JSON-seralizable by the standard ``json.JSONEncoder``.

    A **signal dispatch** is the process of emitting a signal and waiting for
    every observer on the signal's code to be called. A signal dispatch, thus,
    is *synchronous*; the execution of the emitter will be resumed once the
    execution of all those observers finish.

    A ``SignalDispatcher`` instance provides :py:meth:`emit` for emitting
    signals, and :py:meth:`observe` for registering callbacks for getting
    notified when signals of a specific code are emitted (that's called
    **observing on** a signal code).

    All **exceptions** raised in a dispatch by the observers will be caught, so
    they won't stop other observers from being called. As the signal emitter
    shouldn't know about the observers, nor about the exceptions they may
    raise, they aren't raised again. Instead, a callback for when exceptions
    happen can be registered with :py:meth:`on_exceptions`.
